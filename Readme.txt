-> This assignment is about reading student data from an input file, calculating various statistics, and outputting the results to both the console and an output file. It comprises of two sections, each containing its set of source code files and header files. Below is a brief explanation of each file in its specific section:


*Section 1 : In Section 1, the program reads student data from an input file, calculates the average score, assigns appropriate letter grade to each student accordingly and outputs the results for each student to both the console and an output file.

1. sec1_main.cpp :
   - Description: Main program file for Section 1 of the assignment.
   - Functionality: Reads student data from an input file, calculates average scores, determines letter grades, and writes the results to an output file and console.

2. sec1_prosecution.cpp :
   - Description: Contains functions used in Section 1 for calculating average scores and determining letter grades. It is included in 'sec1_main.cpp'.

3. sec1_header.h :
   - Description: Header file for Section 1 containing function declarations and global variables. It is included in 'sec1_prosecution.cpp'.

4. sec1_grades.txt :
   - Description: Input file containing student data for Section 1.

5. sec1_output.txt :
   - Description: Output file where the results of Section 1 are written.

6. sec1_executable.exe :
   - Description: The compiled executable file for Section 1 of the assignment.

7. sec1_screenshot_console_output.JPG :
   - Description: Screenshot of the console output from Section 1.

8. sec1_screenshot_textfile_output.JPG :
   - Description: Screenshot of the text file output from Section 1.


*Section 2 : In Section 2, the program processes a different format of student data from another input file, calculates subject-wise averages, assigns grade to each subject accordingly for each student and outputs the results to an output file.

1. sec2_main.cpp :
   - Description: Main program file for Section 2 of the assignment.
   - Functionality: Reads student data from an input file, calculates average scores for each exam, assigns grades, and generates an output file with student details and grades for each subject.

2. sec2_prosecution.cpp :
   - Description: Contains functions used in Section 2 for parsing input, calculating subject wise averages, and assigning grades. It is included in 'sec2_main.cpp'.

3. sec2_header.h :
   - Description: Header file for Section 2 containing function declarations and global variables. It is included in 'sec2_prosecution.cpp'.

4. sec2_grades.txt :
   - Description: Input file containing student data for Section 2.

5. sec2_output.txt :
   - Description: Output file where the results of Section 2 are written.

6. sec2_executable.exe :
   - Description: The compiled executable file for Section 2 of the assignment.

7. sec2_screenshot_textfile_output.JPG :
   - Description: Screenshot of the text file output from Section 2.
